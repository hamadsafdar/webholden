HOW TO RUN:

To install dependencies:
 run `npm run setup` command in the root folder. Will install dependencies of frontend as well as backend.
Some vulnerabilities will be reported which are only because of mismatch of npm or node version.

To run application:
  - Run the migration script of Database.
  - Run `npm start` in the root folder. Will start frontend as well as backend.


P.S. I have modified migration script. May cause some error on Windows. It is requested to download and run the original scrpt. Also I'm attaching the .env file with it.
